I’m pondering this as I hear a ping, the sound of a text arriving, heralding the date of my next dental check up. Immediately my heart begins racing and, in my head, hundreds of plausible excuses start to crowd in as to why I really can’t make this appointment ... I’m at work, I’m picking my daughter up from an activity, I’m on a course, and isn’t there supposed to be a terrible earthquake happening on that day?? (which, bizarrely, wouldn’t even come close, in the fear stakes, to sitting in that BIG, SCARY chair and opening my mouth wide ....)That was me prior to undergoing some hypnotherapy a few years ago – ironically my fear of dentists led me to tactically ignoring some of those helpful texts ... and probably led to a couple of fillings which I wouldn’t have needed otherwise.... because fear is restricting and immobilising, it can stop you doing sensible things (like attending dental appointments), necessary things (plane rides if you need to get somewhere) and even TASTY things, like eating cheese!My daughter (yes, I’m shamelessly exploiting family for this blog..!) had a phobia about what she described as ‘characters’ for many years – people dressed up as different characters, in sweaty costumes with hugely ill-proportioned heads. This fear, known as masklophobia, is actually quite common – largely because it’s important for us to infer different things from facial expression – and can be anxiety-inducing and even slightly creepy, when that is denied to us. Appealing to the logic is not always helpful with phobias ... yes, my daughter could see that a man went into the gents with a duck costume and papier mache head under his arm and then emerged as Donald Duck ... it was clear that Donald was actually an ordinary man dressed up ..... BUT, phobias don’t work like that ... they transcend the logical, the intellect, they are embedded within our sub-conscious and they don’t take too lightly to being told to go away. They are rooted in a previous experience..... this initial experience is often forgotten but the feelings of terror remain. And terror is not an exaggeration for anyone who actually has a true phobia will know. Because having a phobia isn’t the same as being nervous or anxious – feeling anxiety on starting a new job is a natural response to a new situation (not a phobia of offices!). Feeling petrified and immobile at the sight of a tiny house spider is a phobia … there’s a difference (a bit like the difference between a headache and a blinding migraine!).So how can hypnotherapy help?Well hypnotherapy allows the therapist to get right into your sub-conscious and have a root around. Counselling can be great too … but sometimes you really can’t remember that initial experience so it’s difficult to try and ‘unpick it’ simply by talking. Hypnotherapy can use regression whereby we go back to that initial trigger and explore it, putting things into perspective and laying it to rest. I can remember where my dental phobia started – a horrible experience of four teeth taken out under gas, where I can still vividly recall a frightening dream mixed up with a close up of the dentist’s nasal hair and a pair of ‘pliers’ coming towards me. Actually, to get all this in perspective, I needed those teeth out since my mouth was too full, the gas alleviated the pain and I simply had a bad dream. Simply telling me all that never worked but, under hypnosis, amazing things really can happen … your sub-conscious is much more open to suggestion, for example, and the whole episode can be ‘re-framed’ and, in effect, ‘re-lived’ – this time in a relaxed way, therefore removing the fear. This can be done by watching back a memory on a ‘screen’ – removing or reducing its emotional proximity. I was then taken through the whole process of going to the dentist, from receiving the reminder, to entering the waiting room to actually sitting in the chair with my mouth open, all the while feeling relaxed and happy … and that is now how I feel about regular check-ups. I don’t LOVE going to the dentist (it would be weird if I did, right?) but I’m ok with it.<img class="  wp-image-49 aligncenter" src="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/spider.jpg" alt="spider" width="232" height="173" /><h3>I wonder what scares you?

(the sub-text of this: Will you make me cluck like a chicken? !!) ….So, I’m going to try to cover all bases – but please comment at the end if you have unanswered questions and I’ll do my best to get back to you.<h3>F.A.Qs:</h3><ol><li>What is hypnotherapy?Hypnotherapy is a type of psychological therapy which utilizes hypnosis. This process alters our state of consciousness in a way that represses the conscious part of the mind while also revealing or stimulating the subconscious part. This part is susceptible to positive suggestion, which can bring about meaningful change to thoughts, feelings and behaviours. A qualified hypnotherapist is able to use suggestion in an appropriate way to facilitate this change.</li><li>How does hypnotherapy feel?Hypnotherapy feels really relaxing. Different people, however, report slightly different sensations – clients have described it as ‘floating in my own head’ for example, ‘drifting’ and so on. Whatever, your experience, it’s comfortable and pleasant! Many people also experience time distortion, where a 40 minute session can seem like 5 or 10.</li><li>Will I fall asleep?The hypnotic trance is not the same as being asleep. However, you will probably feel detached from everyday life, perhaps in a bit of a bubble. When I’m hypnotized, I’ve sometimes felt like I’m in that ‘space’ between waking and sleeping – completely aware of what is going on but reluctant to emerge back into normal life. It’s a lovely, relaxing feeling – you’ll love it!</li><li>Can I be made to do something I don’t want to?You are in control at all times. Stage hypnosis works on the principle that the participants want to engage in extrovert behaviour – you don’t volunteer for a stage show unless you are willing to make a bit of a fool of yourself. In a hypnotherapy session, you cannot be made to do something that you don’t want to. Moreover, the therapeutic relationship is one of trust and you and the therapist will have discussed your goals for treatment in depth.</li><li>Can everyone be hypnotized?Everyone can be hypnotized if they want to be – if you go for treatment, you need to be able to relax into it. Clients are sometimes nervous the first time but a good therapist should explain the process to you so that any fears are allayed.</li><li>What issues can hypnotherapy be used for?Hypnotherapy is a fantastic type of therapy for lots of different issues including anxiety and stress-related issues, phobias, weight loss, stopping smoking, habit-type behaviours and even pain management. I treat lots of people for anxiety with hypnotherapy and get great results.</li><li>How many sessions of hypnotherapy will I need?This is a really difficult question to answer because everyone is different. So, for example, for a habit like nail biting, one person may stop after 1 session while others may take 3. For deep-seated issues such as anxiety, I usually think that 4 is the magic number but again it’s personal and you need to talk to your therapist about it.</li><li>How successful is hypnotherapy as a treatment?It’s very successful – I see the positive effects of hypnotherapy regularly and it’s amazing to see people who now feel liberated as a result of treatment. Of course, it’s not a ‘miracle cure’ and you need to work with it – just like any other form of treatment.</li></ol>There are probably loads more questions that I could cover!

He is clever, well-behaved, polite and … well, just perfect in every conceivable way possible.

Sadly, many of us buy into the allure of the ‘perfect’ and wonder why we feel so much anxiety trying to reach it … and so disappointed with ourselves when we don’t.&nbsp;Targets, objectives, assessments, performance management at work, for example, can all conspire to set parameters for us which can add to pressure and actually be counter-productive. There’s no harm in striving to do well, of course, but often targets are set in an unrealistic way which set people up to fail. Sometimes, it can be a simple as being straight with your boss and saying that you need a bit more time for something. Or just having the strength to say ‘No’ for once. Funnily enough, I left a profession heavily reliant on targets … only to make my own targets for myself in my own business. The difference is that my targets are realistic and, although sometimes challenging, achievable. I also changed my mind-set … ‘failure’ became an opportunity to do something in a different way, a step towards a goal rather than reaching it immediately.The workplace is just one area where we try to live up to sometimes unrealistic expectations. How many of the women reading this, are working mums …..trying to be the perfect employee AND the perfect mum?? Yes, it’s true that, as women, we can have a great career and a family these days but do we have to be ‘perfect’ at both? Of course not!

For those readers who don’t, basically Perfect Peter, as he is dubbed, is this amazingly good child who never puts a foot wrong. He is clever, well-behaved, polite and well, just perfect in every conceivable way possible.</p><p>Is he the most interesting character in the book? – no;</p><p>Does he has the most fun? – no;</p><p>Is he the happiest character? – no;</p><p>Is he the most likely to suffer from anxiety-related issues? – YES.</p><p>Maintaining perfection is just REALLY hard work!</p><p>Because perfectionism is not good for us 'perfect' is an adjective which doesn’t reflect reality, yet it is thrust upon us frequently, inviting us to fail at every turn.</p><p>Sadly, many of us buy into the allure of the ‘perfect’ and wonder why we feel so much anxiety trying to reach it and so disappointed with ourselves when we don’t.</p><p>Targets, objectives, assessments, performance management at work, for example, can all conspire to set parameters for us which can add to pressure and actually be counter-productive.</p><p>There’s no harm in striving to do well, of course, but often targets are set in an unrealistic way which set people up to fail. Sometimes, it can be a simple as being straight with your boss and saying that you need a bit more time for something. Or just having the strength to say ‘No’ for once.</p><p>Funnily enough, I left a profession heavily reliant on targets only to make my own targets for myself in my own business. The difference is that my targets are realistic and, although sometimes challenging, achievable. I also changed my mind-set ‘failure’ became an opportunity to do something in a different way, a step towards a goal rather than reaching it immediately.</p><p>The workplace is just one area where we try to live up to sometimes unrealistic expectations. How many of the women reading this, are working mums, trying to be the perfect employee AND the perfect mum?? Yes, it’s true that, as women, we can have a great career and a family these days but do we have to be ‘perfect’ at both? Of course not!</p><p>Do we allow ourselves to shrug it off, dust ourselves down and try again when it all goes tits up?

So, for example, being a bit wary of spiders isn’t the same as being arachnophobic. Phobias aren’t always entirely irrational – in the sense that some spiders, for example, ARE dangerous and should be avoided. But a phobia will assume that ALL spiders – even a tiny house spider – is a threat.So what are the 5 most common? (be warned – there are pictures!)<ul> <li>Arachnophobia – fear of spiders.  Arachnophobia is the most common phobia – sometimes even a picture can induce feelings of panic.

So, for example, being a bit wary of spiders isn’t the same as being arachnophobic. Phobias aren’t always entirely irrational – in the sense that some spiders, for example, ARE dangerous and should be avoided. But a phobia will assume that ALL spiders – even a tiny house spider – is a threat.So what are the 5 most common? (be warned – there are pictures!)<ul> <li>Arachnophobia – fear of spiders.  Arachnophobia is the most common phobia – sometimes even a picture can induce feelings of panic.

Who would choose to be dropped off by their nearest and dearest into a situation where the accommodation is seriously under par compared to your family home, you don’t know anyone and you suddenly have to start cooking, washing and generally doing all the things that someone else has been doing for you for years..? It doesn’t sound like a brilliant idea on the face of it – but that’s what is happening to millions of 18 year olds in the UK this month. Of course, the expectation is that it’s going to get a whole lot better – bur right now, it’s tough.So what can students do to make things easier?<ul> <li>Even if you’re shy and nervous, make the effort to go into the communal area of your accommodation – don’t sit in your room all the time.  Leave your door open when you are in there so others know that you are up for a chat. When I first took my son up to uni, we took a big cake – having something to share is a way of making that initial contact and is an ice-breaker.</li> <li>Have a look at the clubs and societies on offer in fresher’s week – create a social life for yourself with other like-minded people.</li> <li>Remind yourself that everyone in your flat or on your course are all in the same boat as you – if you’re all too shy to make the first move, then you’ll never talk to anyone!</li> <li>Be honest about how you feel – you don’t have to off load ALL your fears onto the first person you see but there’s nothing wrong with admitting you’re a bit nervous about starting uni.  Some people can over compensate by creating a whole persona of fake confidence – most people can see through that!</li> <li>Accept that the few couple of weeks WILL be hard – but will get better.</li> <li>Look after yourself – eat well, get some exercise and be good to yourself.</li> <li>Stick with it for a while before rushing home for the weekend.

This type of anxious breathing can make anxiety even worse. Doing calm breathing can help lower your child’s anxiety, and give him or her a sense of control … and of course, it’s something that your child can do by themselves when you’re not around to help and support them. It really is a ‘portable’ tool and no one knows that you’re doing it. This is often very important for children and young people because they don’t want to be seen as different or needing special help in any way.<h3>How to help your child master the technique:</h3><ol> <li>Explain why calm breathing is a good ‘trick’ to learn. You can explain, for example, that taking short quick breaths actually increases other feelings of anxiety (e.g. heart racing, dizziness, or headaches) … and conversely, slow breathing helps to automatically calm you down.</li> <li>Teach the calm breathing technique: Take a slow breath in through the nose (for about 4 seconds) Hold your breath for 1 or 2 seconds Exhale slowly through the mouth (over about 4 seconds) Wait 2-3 seconds before taking another breath (5-7 seconds for teenagers) Repeat for at least 5 to 10 breaths</li></ol><a href="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bubble.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-187 alignleft" src="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bubble.jpg" alt="bubble" width="200" height="128" /></a>‘Bubble blowing’ is a great way to practice some of this and there it’s fun! You have to take a slow, deep breath to make a big bubble, and you have to blow the bubble really slowly or it will pop. Practise doing that with your child. Take a slow, deep breath in, hold it for a second, and then slowly blow some bubbles, the challenge being to make the bubbles as big as possible – that takes control!For Older Children and Teens: Since calm breathing involves taking slow, controlled breaths from the diaphragm, another way to explain this technique is to present it as “belly breathing”. The steps for this exercise are as follows: Inhale slowly for 4 seconds through the nose. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is blowing up a balloon in the belly, so your child’s belly should inflate when inhaling. Wait 2 seconds, and then slowly exhale through the mouth. Ask your child to pretend that he or she is emptying the balloon of air, so the tummy should deflate. Wait 2 seconds, and then repeat. Helpful Hint: When belly breathing, make sure your child’s upper body (shoulders and chest area) is fairly relaxed and still. Only the belly should be moving! Step 3: Practice, practice, practice! In order for your child to be able to use this new tool effectively, he or she first needs to be an expert at calm breathing.<h3>Rules of practice:<a href="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/practice.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-188 alignright" src="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/practice.jpg" alt="practice" width="229" height="197" /></a></h3><ul> <li>Practice a couple of times a day, doing 10 calm breaths in a row.</li> <li>Practice when you’re both feeling relaxed (if you’re doing it together)</li> <li>Once your child is really comfortable with the technique, they can start to use it in more anxious or stressful situations</li> <li>It’s a skill – it needs to be learned and practiced if it is going to be useful!</li></ul>Good Luck,Judith<a href="http://www.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/">www.bluebell-therapy.co.uk</a><a href="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-64 alignleft" src="http://blog.bluebell-therapy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logo.jpg" alt="logo" width="104" height="104" /></a>'),content:'What is “calm breathing”?Calm breathing is a technique that teaches your child to slow down his or her breathing when feeling stressed or anxious.When we are anxious, we tend to take short, quick, shallow breaths or even hyperventilate.
